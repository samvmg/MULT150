    1. Is the game too easy or hard? It's too easy, player input makes no impact on gameplay.
    2. What would make it easier or harder? It would make it more challenging if the player controlled the movement of the balls.
    3. What would give it a "wow" factor? Giving it a time counter.
    4. What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious? The movement and dynamics of the ball movement make it look fun; waiting for the balls to enter the goals on their own makes it tedious and boring.
    5. The improvements I have made in-game include:
        - Changing size and shape of player's bumper
        - Try covering up water with other game objects around the border of the arena
        - Try adding variations of the chaos balls
        - Try changing the footsteps audio to something that makes more sense with the water
