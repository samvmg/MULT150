Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
I think it has an acceptable amount of difficulty - it's not boring nor engaging enough to keep a player coming back for more than one sitting. It lies on the easier side
because it becomes predictable really fast - the phase out power gives an extra layer of security to the player too. 

What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
Perhaps adding a variability to the obstacles where one type immediatly ends the game, or adding a power up that's significantly better but harder to get due to it's speed, 
could improve its playability. The visual aspect of the game could be improved as well with more detail, and it goes without saying that sound effects would make the experience
more engaging and rewarding.

List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
Like I mentioned, sound design and perhaps a better visual. Maybe adding points so the player can unlock different characters would encourage players to keep playing and also
rewards them by giving them the ability to customize their experience.

What 2 parts of the game are fun? 
The time-based aspect. The sense of urgency and immediate positive feedback for collecting power-ups is very satisfying. Also the fact that you can see the human character on the
screen instead of it just being a simple object like a cube.

What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
The lack of variability and predictability. There's little rewards for playing more than a couple times.

Changes made:
1. Changed the light of the powerup object to blue instead of light yellow, as well as the speed of the particles and shape (to circle)
2. Changed the material of the ground.
3. Changed albedo of both prefabs.
